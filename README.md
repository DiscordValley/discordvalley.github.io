# About The Valley:

The Valley is a farming simulator for Discord. Servers can create their own "communities", and compete with each other on levels, equipment, and currency. Farming is done in sped-up "real time", so your crops will grow while you chat with friends. The main homepage for The Valley can be found at [discordvalley.com](https://discordvalley.com).
