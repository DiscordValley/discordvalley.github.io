# Profile Commands

The `profile` command shows your player card. You can run the command to view (or show off!) your balance, XP, level, and much more. As more trackable tasks are added (ie: Adventures), they too will show up on your profile.

!!! note
    You will need to have a profile on the bot before you can see it on the website. While much still missing from the website, having a profile will allow you to use all up and coming features.
