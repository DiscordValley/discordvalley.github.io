# Leaderboard Commands

The `leaderboard` command has multiple aliases: `lead`, `top`, `leader`, `board`. All will run the `leaderboard` command. The leaderboard will show the top five individuals, based on experience, in the server.

!!! note
    We will be adding multiple ways to sort the leader board based on server preference. There will be a setting in the configurations that allows Admins to base the leaderboard off gold, adventures, etc.
