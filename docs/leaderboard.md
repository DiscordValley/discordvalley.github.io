## Leader Board Commands

The `leaderboard` command has a couple of aliases: `lead`, `top`, `leader`, `board`. All of those will run the same command. The leader board will show the top five individuals, based on experience, in the server.

!!! note
    We will be adding multiple ways to sort the leader board based on Server Admins. There will be a setting in the configurations that will allow Admins to base the leader board off gold, adventures, etc.
