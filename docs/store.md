## Store Commands

The store is a major part of new and old players. It will be your main source for gaining coins for a while, and also getting starting equipment/seeds for new users.

    Some of these commands take more than one argument. Please make sure you give all arguments!

## Commands

| Command      | Description                          |
| :---------: | :----------------------------------: |
| `store`       | `store` will show the user whats available to buy. There will be multiple pages, so make sure you look at all pages!|
| `store desc <<item name>>`       | This will show the user details about an item. There will be details here that are not shown on the normal store command, such as `modifier`, `durability`, and `description`. |
| `store sell <<item name>> <<quantity>>`    | Sell command takes the `item name` supplied, with `quantity`, and take the item from your inventory. If you don't have the item in your inventory, this command will not work. If you want to sell all of your given item, supply the command with `all` in the quantity. |
| `store buy <<item name>> <<quantity>>`    | Buy command works similarly as the sell command, but instead of selling, you are taking in an item available in the store. |
