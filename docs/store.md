| `store sell <item name> <quantity>`    | The item and quantity specified are sold. If you don't have the item in your inventory, this command will not work, and if you want to sell all of your given item, supply the command with `all` in the quantity. |
| `store buy <item name> <quantity>`    | The buy command is quite similar to sell. The same conditions apply for modifiers, but you cannot buy all of the store's stock. |
