    You've successfully navigated to the docs. Horray! Now for some boring info before you get to the start farming.

## Discord Valley Bot

Welcome! You've added our bot (or just looking for more information on our bot) to your server! Your first step is complete! Next is to learn how to use the bot. Good news, you are in the right place for that! This is the main file though, and you will only find information about the core bot here.

## Sponsorship

We will have paid tiers of our bot in the future. We will make sure everyone is aware of the tiers when they become available. If you want to support us before then, add one of us on Discord, and we can give you our links for support!

## Developers

We love our devs, and they worked hard to make this possible. If you loved the bot, show them some love, and go follow their GitHub accounts! They have many other great bots that they worked on.
