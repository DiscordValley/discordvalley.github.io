# The Valley - Discord Bot

Welcome! You've added our bot to your server (or just may be looking for more information on our bot)! Your first step is complete! Next is to learn how to use the bot. Good news is, you're in the right place for that! Split off from this index are many pages related to each feature of the bot, and a convenient search at the top that can match anything you need.

## Sponsorship

We will have paid tiers of our bot in the future. We will make sure everyone is aware of the tiers when they become available. If you want to support us before then, feel free to donate at our GitHub repository!

## Developers

We love our devs, and they worked hard to make this possible. If you loved the bot, then show them some love too, and follow their GitHub accounts! They have many other great bots and projects they have worked on.
