## Market Information

The Marketplace is a `COMING SOON` feature. We are finishing up the normal bot first before we start adding more to our plates! However we do have many great things planned for Adventures. Below is a checklist of what we plan on doing. 

* [ ] Ability for users to have an `eBay` like marketplace to sell items obtained from Adventures or Mining
* [ ] Users will be able to price their items as a `BUY IT NOW` or `AUCTION`
* [ ] Users will have a Marketplace profile that will show their success rate on selling items, fairness in prices, items sold, and gold gained.
* [ ] Ability to search items and compare sellers

!!! info
    Market is planned to be a `free` expansion. We are waiting to implement this until we get more users and other item producing events done.
