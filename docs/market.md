# Marketplace Information

The marketplace is a `COMING SOON` feature, but a high priority one! We have many great things planned for market, and while you can't use them quite yet, below is a checklist of what is in the works.

- [ ]  Ability for users to have a marketplace to sell items obtained from adventures or mining.
- [ ] Users will be able to price their items as a `BUY IT NOW` or `AUCTION`.
- [ ] Users will have a marketplace profile that will show their success rate on selling items, fairness in prices, items sold, and gold gained.
- [ ] Ability to search items and compare sellers.

!!! info
Market is planned to be a `free` expansion. We are waiting to implement this until we get more users and other item producing events done.
